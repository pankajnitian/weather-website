                                                                                Weather Website Project


This project is a responsive weather web application built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this application is to provide users with real-time weather data for any location they search for.

Key Features:
Real-time Weather Data:

The app fetches current weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general weather conditions using an external weather API.
Users can search for any city or location worldwide and get up-to-date weather information.
API Integration:

The app connects to a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap or a similar service) to retrieve accurate weather data in JSON format. This data is then processed and displayed in a user-friendly manner.
Interactive User Interface:

Responsive design: The app is designed to work well on different screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktop computers.
Dynamic content: As the user inputs a city name, the app fetches the relevant data from the API and updates the displayed information in real-time without needing to refresh the page.
The interface is clean, with a visually appealing design, including a custom logo and intuitive layout to make the user experience smooth and engaging.
Technologies Used:

HTML: For creating the structure of the webpage.
CSS: Custom styles are implemented to enhance the look and feel of the app. The styling provides a modern and minimalistic look with well-organized information.
JavaScript: Handles API calls, processes the retrieved data, and updates the DOM (Document Object Model) with the latest weather details based on the user's input.
Project Structure:

index.html: The main HTML file responsible for the webpage's structure.
style.css: Contains custom CSS for designing the layout and visual elements.
script.js: Includes JavaScript code to handle user input, make API requests, and display weather data dynamically.
logo.svg: A custom logo that adds branding to the application.
How It Works:
Users enter the name of a city in the input field.
When they hit the search button, the JavaScript code triggers an API request to fetch weather data.
The retrieved data is parsed and displayed, showing the temperature, humidity, weather description, and other important details.
Potential Improvements:
Implement error handling for incorrect or invalid city names.
Add additional features like a 5-day weather forecast, weather-related icons, or temperature conversion (Celsius/Fahrenheit).
Allow users to detect their location automatically using the Geolocation API.
